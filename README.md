# Super Meat Boy randomizer
Inspired by randomizers for games such as Pok√©mon, and Super Mario World, this tool will shuffle all levels of Super Meat Boy except for character warp zone levels and boss levels. The effect can be reverted by restarting the game.

Note: This will not update any Steam leaderboard best times, only your save file's best times.
